Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was a small start up company of about 3-4 imployees. Their goal was to increase the pass rate for the driving test/exam by providing an application that let students study by having access to materials and tests. These would be updated by the DMV to match current information. They would also be able to schedule drives 

What did you do particularly well?

On this assingment I believe I did well at figuring out what the company needed and making the connections between different user's of the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my software requirements as I believe I did a poor job on this assignment. I would do a more robust investigation into what tools and software they truely need to get the job done. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I broke down the users needs into different UML diagrams showing the different use cases and interactions. It is important to take their needs into account as they are your client and you should be doing everything you can to deliver on their wishes.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would build user stories based off the information that I gather in the beginning. I would also bring in a budget so i new where they stood on the software cost and what they needed to make this project work.
